"""0.7.4 tests: the brief opens in prose.

The composed sentences were only visible in a log file or a
diagnostics download, which is no place to judge whether they read
well. They now open the daily brief: history in the order it
happened, then what is standing. The tables stay for scanning, and
the same composer feeds both so they cannot disagree.

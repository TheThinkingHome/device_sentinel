"""The Device Sentinel integration.

Watches hardware liveness: frozen devices, unavailable devices, low
batteries, and weak radio links, with per-device freeze windows
learned from each device's own reporting rhythm rather than
hand-assigned tiers.

Battery detection is live. The telemetry recorder learns rhythms and
signal baselines continuously. Freeze and unavailability detection,
signal detection, and the notification engine arrive in later steps;
their configuration surfaces and the problem list are already built
and inert.

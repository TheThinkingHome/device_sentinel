"""What the dashboard reads from the coordinator.

Two things, both small. The change marker is a counter that moves when
something a person would want to see has happened: a problem opened,
closed or changed, a system event was recorded, or midnight folded a
new day. The dashboard's Refresh button changes colour when the marker
has moved past the snapshot on screen. The header status is the same
facts the bridge, broker and Wi-Fi sensors show, read from the same
coordinator properties, so the dashboard and the entities can never
disagree.
